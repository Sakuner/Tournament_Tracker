# Tournament_Tracker

This is a Windows Forms app for creating a tournaments with prizes. Tournaments include teams with members, matchups and rounds. 
Tournament Tracker can use a text file (in a .csv format) or an sql database with stored procedures for data storage. 


App was build as part of the C# course from Tim Correy. The goal of creating this app was to exercise and learn more about programming in C# and SQL
in a more advanced way than by just doing smaller tasks.
